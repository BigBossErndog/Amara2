- Game architecture inspired by the best elements of the Phaser framework and the Godot Engine.
- Code-focused game engine that attempts to unify all existing tools a game developer may use into a cohesive experience.

## Setup
### Windows
Download the windows zip file from the latest release:

Run "Amara2.exe".

#### *Building your project*
Amara2 requires VS Build Tools from Microsoft to build your final game.
You don't have to install it until you need to build your game.

Download the installer from:

When you run the installer, select "Desktop development with C++".

Once installation is completed, you are ready to use Amara2.
